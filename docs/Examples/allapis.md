# Generate Reports

Our robust reporting API provides you with the ability to integrate your systems directly with the financial and non-financial reporting APIs.  You may want to search an authorization based on an order ID within your online support tool, you may want to reconcile your funding event against the settlement records and show the result within your financial tool etc.
 
These are the object types available for reporting and you can utilize the summary or search API.
