# The personal data we collect

We collect personal data about individuals from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why individuals must provide us with personal data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so.

***Information that we collect directly from individuals and the parties with which we do business***

We may collect personal data directly from individuals and the parties with which we do business, including prospects. These may include parties that interact with us directly (such as individuals who download our mobile applications or job applicants), parties to which we provide goods or services (such as clients, banks or financial institutions, merchants, and individuals) (collectively, “**clients**”), parties that provide services to us (such as vendors) (collectively, “**service providers**”), and other parties with whom we offer or provide products and services (such as independent sales organizations) (collectively, “**partners**”). 

We may collect information from these parties in a variety of contexts, such as when completing one of our online forms, making an application for one of our products or services, interacting with us on social media, or corresponding with us. The types of information we obtain in these contexts include:

- Contact information of the business entity and its personnel who interact with us, such as name, job title, address, telephone number, and email address
- Profile information, such as username and password that an individual may establish on one of our websites or mobile applications, along with any other information that an individual enters into their account profile
- Demographic details, such as date of birth, country of citizenship and/or country of residence
- Information about individuals’ affiliation with a legal entity, such as an individual’s role, and whether he or she is a beneficial owner or authorized signatory
- Government-issued identification numbers (to the extent permitted under applicable law), such as a national identification number (e.g., a Social Security Number, tax identification number, or passport number), state or local identification number (e.g., a Driver’s License or other government-issued identification number), and a copy of your government-issued identification card
- Feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide when you request information from us, receive customer support, or otherwise correspond with us, including by interacting with our pages on social networking online sites or services
- Financial account information, such as payment card or bank account details 
- Information about merchants, such as merchant name, merchant ID and category code, merchant location where a transaction occurred, and information about transactions processed by the merchant, including transaction volume, velocity, amounts, types of goods or services sold, and chargeback ratios
- Information related to the use of Fiserv products or services, such as account information, spending thresholds, spending activity and patterns, and information about the transactions we process
- Precise geolocation information, if you authorize our mobile application to access your location
- Marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications and details about how you engage with our marketing communications
- Other information supplied by job applicants, such as professional credentials and skills, educational and work history, and other information of the type included on a resume or curriculum vitae

***Information that we collect about individuals who do not interact with us directly***

We may receive personal data about individuals who do not interact with us directly. For example, our clients, service providers, and partners may provide us with information about individuals other than themselves when using our products or services. In addition, due to the unique nature of Fiserv’s business, in many cases, Fiserv obtains personal data from other participants in a transaction processing chain, such as card associations and debit network operators and their members. The types of information we receive about third parties includes:

- Information about the personnel of our clients, service providers, or partners, such as the business contact information that our clients, service providers, or partners provide to us in the context of our contractual relationships with them
- Information about potential job candidates, such as when a recruiter contacts us about an individual who may become a candidate for a job at Fiserv
- Information about customers of our clients that our clients send to us or allow us to collect in the context of the services that Fiserv performs, such as information related to financial transactions initiated by the customer, account registrations, and in some cases information needed to verify a customer’s identity and details of products or services purchased, and as otherwise stated in an applicable specific privacy notice for a Fiserv product or service. Where our technology is incorporated into a merchant’s mobile application or website, we also may automatically collect certain information of the type described in the section below titled “Information collected via automated means.”
- Information obtained when processing transactions, such as information about payment transactions

***Information we collect from private and publicly accessible sources***

We and our service providers may collect information about individuals that is publicly available, including by searching publicly accessible government lists of restricted or sanctioned persons (such as the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List), public records databases (such as company registries and regulatory filings), and by searching media and the internet. We and or our third-party verification providers may also collect information from private or commercially available sources, such as by requesting reports or information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, to the extent permitted under applicable law. 

We may also maintain pages for our company and our products and services on a variety of third-party platforms, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, and other social networking services. When you interact with our pages on those third-party platforms, the third-party’s privacy policy will govern your interactions on the relevant platform. If the third-party platform provides us with information about our pages on those platforms or your interactions with them, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

***Information collected via automated means***

When you access our websites or use our mobile applications, we, our service providers, and our partners may automatically collect information about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity on our websites or mobile applications. Typically, this information includes your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier (such as the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising), browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, general location information such as city, state or geographic area; and information about your use of and actions on or in our websites or mobile applications, such as pages or screens you accessed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access. Certain products or services that we provide or which merchants may incorporate into their websites or mobile applications may automatically collect additional information, as may be further described in a separate privacy notice.

Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites. This information is collected via various mechanisms, such as via cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, through our mobile applications, and similar technologies. This type of information may also be collected when you read our HTML-enabled emails. Please refer to our [Cookies Notice](https://www.fiserv.com/en/legal/cookie-statement.html) for more details. You can choose to disable cookies or to opt out of the use of your browsing behaviour for purposes of targeted advertising. For opt out instructions, please review the “[Targeted online advertising](#your-rights-and-choices)” portion of the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Notice.

***Sensitive personal data***

In limited circumstances and when permitted by law, we may request biometric data to confirm your identity, such as when we authenticate a payment using your fingerprint. In some circumstances, we may collect information that may reveal health or medical information, such as when we process transactions at health or medical facilities or pharmacies. In the context of processing employment applications, we may also request sensitive information, such as racial or ethnic origin or information about disability, where required or permitted by law of the country in which you are applying for employment.

Outside of these contexts or otherwise as we specifically request, we ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal data (meaning information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic, health, or biometric information, information about sex life or sexual orientation, or criminal convictions or offenses) through our websites or mobile applications, or otherwise to us.

These third parties may use your information only as directed by Fiserv and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Notice, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your information for any other purpose.

***Our clients***

When Fiserv performs services for its clients, it may share personal data with those entities. For example, Fiserv may collect information about a client’s customers from or on behalf of the client, such as when Fiserv processes payment transactions, and Fiserv may provide personal data about those customers back to the client.

***Targeted online advertising***

Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on our websites or in our mobile applications may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising.

Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through participating members of the following organizations or programs:

- [Network Advertising Initiative (USA)](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1)
- [Digital Advertising Alliance (USA)](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN)

Users of mobile applications may opt out of receiving targeted advertising in mobile applications through participating members of the Digital Advertising Alliance by installing the AppChoices mobile application, available [here](https://youradchoices.com/appchoices), and selecting the user’s choices. In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit our, or our partners’, ability to engage in ad tracking or targeted advertising using the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising associated with your mobile device.

Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms and may not participate in the opt-out mechanisms that we linked above. 

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online, but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to opt out, not all companies that serve online behavioural advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored advertisements from companies that are not listed.
