# Card Developer Documentation has migrated to Developer Studio

Fiserv is no longer onboarding new developer accounts on Card Developer Portal. If you have an existing relationship, we have streamlined the process for you to migrate existing API Keys and company developers to Developer Studio.

To migrate existing API Keys  â€“ [Getting Started When Migrating](/product/CardDeveloper/docs/?path=/docs/gettingstarted/getting-started-when-migerating.md)

You will find detailed documentation in Developer Studio - [Card Developer](/product/CardDeveloper)
 
For any issues, please email us at CS_API_Product_Management@fiserv.com
