# API Glossary
## Overview
Developer Studio’s API glossary is a list of programming and API-related terms, acronyms, and phrases to help you understand the terminology. Browse the glossary and learn to speak as a developer! 

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An API allows two software programs to communicate with each other. One program can call another program’s API to get access to data or functionality of the other program. 

A simpler way to think about this: when you go to a restaurant, a waiter will take your order and send it to the kitchen. The kitchen makes your food and the waiter brings it back to your table. 

In this example, one program is the person ordering food and the other program is the kitchen. The waiter represents the API, that is used to receive requests and return something. In this case, the waiter returns your order, but an actual API would return data or other functionality. 

### Documentation
Documentation is a technical guide that contains instructions on how to use and integrate the API. The guide can have code samples, technical writing, and use cases.  

### Developer portal
Developer portal is a platform how developers understand, interact, build and monitor API integrations. 

### Endpoint
An endpoint is the point of entry in a communication channel when two systems are interacting. It refers to touchpoints of the communication between an API and a server. The endpoint is a URL that enables the API to gain access to resources on a server to perform their task. 

### Parameters
API parameter is an option that can be passed with the endpoint to influence the response. 

### Sandbox
An environment testers can use to mimic the characteristics of the production environment and create responses.
