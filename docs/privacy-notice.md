# Privacy Notice

**Effective Date: January 1, 2022**

This “Privacy Notice” describes the practices of Open Banking…Fiserv, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Fiserv”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) and the rights and choices available to individuals, regarding personal data. Personal data means any information that relates to an identifiable individual.

Fiserv may provide additional or supplemental privacy notices to individuals at the time we collect their data, which will govern how we may process the information provided at that time. We may alter this Privacy Notice as needed to abide by local laws or regulations around the world, such as by providing supplemental information in certain countries. This Privacy Notice does not apply to Fiserv’s processing of the personal data of its personnel, such as employees and contractors. 

## The personal data we collect

We collect personal data about individuals from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why individuals must provide us with personal data, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. 

*A. Information that we collect about Developers and their personnel*

We may collect personal data directly from Developers (including prospective customers) about themselves and their personnel. We may collect information from these parties in a variety of contexts, such as when completing one of our online forms, making an application for one of our products or services, interacting with us on social media, or corresponding with us. The types of information we obtain in these contexts include:
- Contact information of the business entity and its personnel who interact with us, such as name, job title, address, telephone number, and email address
- Profile information, such as username and password that an individual may establish on one of our websites or mobile applications, along with any other information that an individual enters into their account profile
- Demographic details, such as date of birth, country of citizenship and/or country of residence
- Information about individuals’ affiliation with a legal entity, such as an individual’s role, and whether he or she is a beneficial owner or authorized signatory
- Government-issued identification numbers (to the extent permitted under applicable law), such as a national identification number (e.g., a Social Security Number, tax identification number, or passport number), state or local identification number (e.g., a Driver’s License or other government-issued identification number), and a copy of your government-issued identification card
- Feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide when you request information from us, receive customer support, or otherwise correspond with us, including by interacting with our pages on social networking online sites or services
- Financial account information, such as payment card or bank account details
- Information about Developers, such as Developer name, Developer ID and  Developer location
- Information related to a Developer’s use of Fiserv products or services
- Marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications, Developer surveys, and details about how you engage with our marketing communications

*B. Information that we collect from private and publicly accessible sources*

We and our service providers may collect information about individuals that is publicly available, including by searching publicly accessible government lists of restricted or sanctioned persons (such as the Specially Designated Nationals And Blocked Persons List), public records databases (such as company registries and regulatory filings), and by searching media and the internet. We and or our third party verification providers may also collect information from private or commercially available sources, such as by requesting reports or information from credit reference and fraud prevention agencies, to the extent permitted under applicable law.

We may also maintain pages for our company and our products and services on a variety of third-party platforms, such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, and other social networking services. When individuals interact with our pages on those third-party platforms, the third-party’s privacy policy will govern your interactions on the relevant platform. If the third-party platform provides us with information about our pages on those platforms or your interactions with them, we will treat that information in accordance with this Privacy Notice.

*C. Information collected via automated means*

When you access our websites or use our mobile applications, we, our service providers, and our partners may automatically collect information about you, your computer or mobile device, and activity on our websites or mobile applications. Typically, this information includes your computer or mobile device operating system type and version number, manufacturer and model, device identifier (such as the Google Advertising ID or Apple ID for Advertising), browser type, screen resolution, IP address, the website you visited before browsing to our website, general location information such as city, state or geographic area; and information about your use of and actions on or in our websites or mobile applications, such as pages or screens you accessed, how long you spent on a page or screen, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times, and length of access. Certain products or services that we provide or which Developers may incorporate into their websites or mobile applications may automatically collect additional information, as may be further described in a separate privacy notice.

Our service providers and business partners may collect this type of information over time and across third-party websites. This information is collected via various mechanisms, such as via cookies, web beacons, embedded scripts, through our mobile applications, and similar technologies. This type of information may also be collected when you read our HTML-enabled emails. Please refer to our [Cookies Disclosure](https://www.fiserv.com/en/legal/cookie-statement.html) for more details. You can choose to disable cookies or to opt out of the use of your browsing behaviour for purposes of targeted advertising. For opt out instructions, please review the “[Targeted online advertising](#your-rights-and-choices)” portion of the “Your Choices” section of this Privacy Notice.

*D. Sensitive personal data*

In limited circumstances and when permitted by law, we may collect a Developer’s and/or their employee’s biometric data to confirm a Developer’s and/or their employee’s identity, such as when they authenticate a payment or sign into their Fiserv device using their fingerprint. In some circumstances, we may collect information that may reveal health or medical information, such as when we process transactions at health or medical facilities or pharmacies. In the context of processing employment applications, we may also request sensitive information, such as racial or ethnic origin, where required or permitted by law of the country in which you are applying for employment.

Outside of these contexts or otherwise as we specifically request, we ask that you not provide us with any sensitive personal data (meaning information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic, health, or biometric information, information about sex life or sexual orientation, or criminal convictions or offenses) through our websites or mobile applications, or otherwise to us.

*B. Targeted online advertising*

Some of the business partners that collect information about users’ activities on our websites or in our mobile applications may be members of organizations or programs that provide choices to individuals regarding the use of their browsing behavior or mobile application usage for purposes of targeted advertising. Users may opt out of receiving targeted advertising on websites through participating members of the following organizations or programs:

If you choose to opt-out of targeted advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may not be relevant to you.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
