# Dive into a product
## What is a product?
A product is a Fiserv brand that offers a set of APIs that meet certain needs of a business. Once you've selected a product, you are directed to the product page where you can learn about the APIs offered, read documentation and try out the API sandbox. 
## Available capabilities for the product
There are certain capabilities a product has on Developer Studio. That information is displayed in this section. If you don’t know what the feature is, you can learn about it by clicking on the hyperlink. It will take you to this guide.

## Read use cases to learn about endpoint
Figure out whether the API is the right fit for you by reading its documentation. It’s a technical guide that explains how to use and integrate the API, shows the languages it supports, and provides examples of how implementation would look like.

## Understand Documentation and API Explorer
Now we’re getting into the technical aspect of Developer Studio...

To determine this product or endpoint is what you want to integrate, you can find the answer in “Documentation” and “API Explorer” nested in the left navigation of the Product page. “Documentation” is a technical guide that explains how to use and integrate the API, shows the languages it supports, and provides examples of how implementation would look like. “API Explorer” is where you can find the sandbox for the endpoints.

Once you click on “Documentation”, you’ll land on the “Getting Started” page. On the far right side of the screen, it displays the outline of topics covered on the current page. You can click a section on the outline and it will take you to that part of the page.

Now that you have a better understanding of how the product works after reading documentation, you can try out the endpoint on the API sandbox! An API sandbox is an environment that testers use to mimic the characteristics of the production environment and create simulated responses. 

On the left navigation, the endpoints are grouped based on features. In this case, “Search” is an endpoint of the feature “Authorization”.

It might seem a bit overwhelming, but let’s break down some of the key concepts that we’ll need to know.

**Parameters** are options that can be passed with the endpoint to influence the response. They’re found in strings at the end of the API URL path.

**Request Schema** is the section you can type values in the fields. This section also corresponds to the body of the sandbox (located on the right side of the screen).

IMAGE

**Response Codes** is where you determine the result after you ran the values. In this case, the response came back with 200, which means “Created” (or it came back with a successfully).

IMAGE

**Reponse Schema** is an explanation of the result and lists each property that could possibly be returned.
