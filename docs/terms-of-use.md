The provisions of these Terms which by their nature are intended to survive the termination of these Terms will continue as valid and enforceable obligations of you and Fiserv following termination. For example and without limitation, the provisions regarding Confidential Information, indemnity, limitations of liability, and Fiserv’s Intellectual Property Rights will survive the termination of these Terms.  

20.5  Each party is performing its obligations under these Terms as an independent contractor; nothing in these Terms creates any partnership, joint venture, association, or syndicate among or between you and us, nor confers on you any express or implied right, power or authority to enter into any agreement or commitment on behalf of (nor to impose any obligation upon) us. You have no authority to act on our behalf or to represent us in any transaction, except to the extent we expressly grant you such authority in writing. Any action you take that is not permitted by these Terms or by us shall not bind us or create any claim against our assets. You are liable for all acts and omissions of, and breaches of these Terms by, your employees, agents, independent contractors, and subcontractors.

20.6  You shall not issue a press release, any marketing collateral or statements, or make any other public statement regarding Fiserv, your relationship with Fiserv, these Terms, or the subject matter of these Terms without our prior written consent.

20.7  You shall not subcontract, team, or otherwise assign your obligations, fully or partially, under these Terms to any third party without our prior written consent. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your rights granted under these Terms, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without our prior written consent. A change of control of you will be deemed an assignment. All provisions of these Terms will be binding on permitted successors and assignees. Any assignment that does not comply with this Section 19.7 will be void and have no effect.

20.8  These Terms will be governed by New York law (without regard to its choice of law provisions). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods to these Terms is expressly excluded and the Uniform Computer Information Act does not apply to these Terms. Fiserv and you and us waive any right to have a jury participate in the resolution of any dispute or claim between the parties or any of their respective Affiliates or employers or any other intended beneficiary for claims arising under or relating to these Terms.

20.9  No failure or delay by either party (or any of its agents) in enforcing any provisions, exercising any right, or requiring performance of any provisions, will be construed to be a waiver of the same. Any remedy provided for in these Terms is non-exclusive and in addition to all other remedies available to such party at law, by statute or in equity. All remedies available are cumulative.

20.10  These Terms are for the sole benefit of you and Fiserv; there are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms, provided, however, Fiserv and our Affiliates, and our respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns shall be considered beneficiaries under these Terms and shall each have the right to enforce the provisions of these Terms directly, jointly or on their own behalf.  

20.11  We will not be responsible or otherwise in breach if we cannot perform any of our obligations because of any act of God, court order, fire, riot, war, flood, power or telecommunications failure, epidemic or pandemic, or any other cause beyond our reasonable control.

20.14  We may perform our obligations on our own or through our agent(s) and/or subcontractor(s). You must bring any claims arising under these Terms against Fiserv, any of our Affiliates, or any of our respective agent(s) and/or subcontractor(s) solely against Fiserv Solutions, LLC; you shall not bring any claims arising under these Terms against any of our Affiliate(s), agent(s) or subcontractor(s).

20.15  Section headings are for reference purposes only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms. These Terms shall not be construed more strictly against one party than the other, regardless of who drafted these Terms. Each defined word or phrase can be read as singular or plural. “Including” means “including, but not limited to,” and “includes” means “includes, but is not limited to”.  “Written consent” means “express written consent”.

Consequently, Fiserv cannot be held responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in sites listed in any search results or otherwise linked to these Terms.  

20.17  If Fiserv has reason to believe that you have engaged in any of the prohibited activities described in these Terms or have otherwise breached your obligations under these Terms, Fiserv may terminate, suspend or limit your access to or use of the Developer Build Space; notify law enforcement, regulatory authorities, impacted third parties, and others as we deem appropriate; and/or take legal action against you. In addition, Fiserv, in our sole discretion, reserves the right to terminate your access to the Developer Build Space for any reason and at any time.
