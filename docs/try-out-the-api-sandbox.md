# Try out the API sandbox
## Make an API call
Now that you have a better understanding of how the product works after reading documentation, you can try out the endpoint on the API sandbox! An API sandbox is an environment that testers use to mimic the characteristics of the production environment and create simulated responses. 

On the left navigation, the endpoints are grouped based on features. In this case, “Charges” is an endpoint of the feature “Payments”.

It might seem a bit overwhelming, but let’s break down some of the key concepts that we’ll need to know.


**Parameters** are options that can be passed with the endpoint to influence the response. They’re found in strings at the end of the API URL path.

**Request Schema** is the section for you to type values in the fields (the grey boxes). This section also corresponds to the body of the sandbox (located on the right side of the screen).

Wherever you decide to enter your values, after you’re done, you’ll press “Run” to send the changes to the system and it’ll return a response. 

**Reponse Schema** is an explanation of the result and lists each property that could possibly be returned.

**Response Codes** is where you determine the result after you ran the values. In this case, the response came back with “200”, which means “Created” (or it came back with a successfully).
