  20.4  These Terms immediately terminate when your Developer Account is terminated. The provisions of these Terms which by their nature are intended to survive the termination of these Terms will continue as valid and enforceable obligations of you and Fiserv following termination.

A change of control of you will be deemed an assignment. All provisions of these Terms will be binding on permitted successors and assignees. Any assignment that does not comply with this Section 19.7 will be void and have no effect.
