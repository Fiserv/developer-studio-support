# Register the tenant

## Documentation Quickstart Guide

Now that the tenant is configured and deployed we now need to register the URL with the `Fiserv Developer Studio.`

Head to [Tenant Registration]

After you fill in the requested information your tenant will now show in the `Fiserv Developer Studio`.

Head to [Fiserv Developer Studio]

You will find your tenant under the `Merchants` or `Financial Instutions` area based on how you have configured `solution` tag in `tenant.json` file.

Congratulations, you've got a working tenant in the `staging` system.

To have your tenant show up in the `production` system finish editing your content and simply `publish` it to the `main` branch in your repositry.  More on that can be found in the [Preview vs Publish]
