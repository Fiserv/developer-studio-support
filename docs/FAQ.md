## Do I need to be a registered user in order to try out your APIs? 
No, you don’t need an account. You can try out the API by using the sandbox on its API Explorer. It’s designed to mimic a real run as closely as possible so you can test your API integration.  

## There is an API I would like to use but cannot find it on the portal. 
Make sure to look for the API on our Search and All APIs page. If you can’t find the API, reach out to our support team and we’ll be happy to help you.
