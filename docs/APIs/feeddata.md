# Data Feeds

If traditional restful APIs do not satisfy your requirements and you would rather get data feeds, we have multiple ways to get your data to you easily and in a timely manner. Choose from one of the following options to consume your data across the value chain.
 
### Snowflake

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com) is a cloud-based data warehousing solution. We have partnered with Snowflake to make [Secure data shares](https://www.snowflake.com/workloads/data-sharing) available. Data is available in your share on a near real-time basis. Authorizations, Gateway, and Value-added services transactions are available within a few seconds. Batch processed objects are available as soon as the processing is complete. No messy ETL, file exchanges etc. to worry about. Spin up your [Warehouses](https://www.snowflake.com/workloads/data-warehouse-modernization) and join/mingle it with your data in Snowflake. Use traditional SQL to query and analyze your data.

If you are interested in this option, please contact your account rep to enable a secure share.
